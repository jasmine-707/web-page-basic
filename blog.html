        <section class="intro">
            <p>
                In user experience (UX) design, we often rely on a variety of user research methods, such as interviews 
                and surveys, to gain insights into user needs and behaviors. We translate this data into actionable outputs 
                such as user stories, flows, personas, and wireframes that inform our designs. While these tools help build 
                and share our understanding, they also sometimes risk taking us away from the core of the design process: 
                real people. The key to creating meaningful, impactful products is to dive into the lives of our users to 
                understand their environments, the challenges they face, and how our solutions can improve their experience. 
                This is what makes storyboarding such a powerful tool in UX design.

            <h2>What Is A Storyboard?</h2>
            <p>
                Storyboard uses specific scripted coherent subplots to show a series of interactive actions. 
                Storyboards are used to highlight a key interaction action, thus bringing to the fore a key task 
                that corresponds to the entire user experience.

        <section class="why-storyboard">
            <h2>Storyboard Is Stronger Than User Persona</h2>
            <p>
                The reason storyboards work better than user personas is that they are better able to effectively 
                communicate user needs and goals and are a great way for design teams to better understand the user 
                experience so that they can turn ideas into real products. In contrast, user personas tend to fall into 
                the causality trap of associating user behavior with irrelevant but easily tracked attributes. 
                Storyboard, however, focuses on finding commonalities between users rather than emphasizing individual differences.

        <section class="steps">
            <h2>3-Steps To Create A Good Storyboard</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1 - Collect your user research data</strong><br>
                    To make your storyboard more relevant to your users’ needs, the most important thing is to collect data first, 
                    such as user interview analysis, secondary research data, and so on.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 2 - Don’t spend too much time on creating a storyboard</strong><br>
                    You just need to make sure that this storyboard you create communicates the needs of your target users. 
                    In order to be efficient, you shouldn’t spend time on the visuals of your storyboard.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 3 - Define your user personas and scenarios</strong><br>
                    You need to make sure that the user personas in your storyboard are specific. In addition, in cases 
                    where there are multiple user path scenarios, you should make sure that your storyboard corresponds 
                    to only one user path.<br>
                    The storyline in a storyboard should start with a specific trigger event and end with the benefits of 
                    your proposed solution and the problems faced by the characters. In short, your storyboard should have 
                    a clear beginning, middle, and end. This helps you better explain to stakeholders the reasons for your 
                    proposed design solution.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Creating a storyboard needs to be based on your user research data, yet it needs to skillfully communicate 
                the conceptual ideas of your proposed design solution. This requires always keeping the user and the scenarios 
                in which they use the product at the center.
